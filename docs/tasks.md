# Ventesca Backend Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of improvement tasks for the Ventesca backend project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Architecture Improvements

- [ ] Implement proper exception handling with domain-specific exceptions instead of generic RuntimeExceptions
- [ ] Resolve circular dependency between CategoryFactory and CategoryRepository
- [ ] Create a proper port/adapter architecture for external dependencies (e.g., productInfoPort)
- [ ] Implement event-driven communication between bounded contexts
- [ ] Add pagination support for list operations
- [ ] Create a consistent validation framework across the application
- [ ] Implement proper error response handling and standardized API responses

## Code Completion

- [ ] Complete the `relocateProducts` method in CategoryService
- [ ] Complete the `validateParentCategory` method in CategoryService
- [ ] Implement the `generateHexColor` method in CategoryFactory
- [ ] Complete the `generateSubcategoryColor` method in CategoryFactory
- [ ] Fix the `ensureUniqueCode` method in CategoryFactory to properly handle duplicates
- [ ] Replace hardcoded product count with actual implementation
- [ ] Fix the return type for `getDefaultCategory()` in CategoryRepository

## Code Quality

- [ ] Remove unnecessary 'open' modifiers from Category properties
- [ ] Fix column name mismatch in Category entity (code vs color)
- [ ] Add proper validation for input parameters in all services
- [ ] Implement consistent logging across all services
- [ ] Replace Spring's StringUtils with Kotlin's built-in string functions
- [ ] Remove extra blank lines and ensure consistent formatting
